This panel allows user upload his data to be analyzed in POMA.  

**Metabolomic Data**: Each row denotes a sample and each column denotes a metabolite.  
**Covariates file (optional)**: Each row denotes a sample (the same as in metabolomic data) and each column denotes covariate.  

**Exploratory report:** You will find a green button with the name "Exploratory report" in the top of central panel. If you "click" this button POMA will generate an automatically exploratory report of your data.   

If you want to upload your data, please select "**No, upload my own data**" button and remember that:    

- Your metabolomic matrix must be a .CSV (*comma-separated-value*) file.
- First/Left-hand column must be sample IDs.
- Second/Left-hand column must be sample groups.
- Ideally, first row should be column names (metabolites). If not, don't worry, POMA will can deal with it if you "click" on **Header** button.  

If you want include a covariates file, please, upload it in "**Upload your covariates file**" and remember:

- Covariates file must be a .CSV (*comma-separated-value*) file.
- First/Left-hand column must be sample IDs. This sample IDs must be same rownames (IDs) than metabolites matrix IDs.  

In case of that you only want is try POMA and you don't have your own dataset... We offer a dataset (default) of a colorectal cancer metabolomic study (from Metabolomics Workbench). This option also include a covariates file of the study.

**NOTE:** _Know that we have modified this dataset so that you can try all the options that POMA offers you._
