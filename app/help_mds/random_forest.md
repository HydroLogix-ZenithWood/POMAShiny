Random forest is a widely used machine learning algorithm in different omics for the purpose of creating prediction models. POMAShiny provides a classification random forest algorithm designed to create prediction models to discriminate between two or more study groups. Different parameters are available in this panel:   

  - Test partition (%): Percentage of observations that are used as test set. Default is 20% of observations. These samples are used only to perform an external validation
  - Number of trees: Number of trees to grow
  - Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split
  - Node Size: Minimum size of terminal nodes
  - Number of Selected Features: Number of features that are shown in the Gini plot
