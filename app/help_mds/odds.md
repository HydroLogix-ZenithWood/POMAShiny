In the Odds Ratio panel users can calculate the odds ratios (OR) ans its confidence intervals based on a logistic regression model. Consequently, this panel allows only two group datasets. By default, all OR are computed. However, users can select specific features in "Select model features" box.      

To include confidence intervals in the plot switch on the "Show CI" button and to include ALL covariates uploaded in the target file in the logistic regression model and in the plot, switch on the "Include covariates" button.
