In this tab, users can explore their data in an interactive volcano plot. This plot is based on the results of a standard T-test which users can define if data are paired or not and if the study group variances are equal or not. This option is only available for two-group studies.       

POMAShiny interactive volcano plot gives users information about T-test significance and fold changes. log2 fold changes between groups are represented in the horizontal axis while -log10 T-test p-values are represented in the vertical axis.      

Users can select if raw p-values or adjusted (FDR) p-values are displayed. Other parameters as p-value threshold, log2 fold change threshold or x-axis range are available in the parameters menu.
