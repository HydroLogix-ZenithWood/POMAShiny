This tab provides a highly interactive boxplot of all data features groupped by their different study groups. Different visualization parameters are available in this tab:

  - Features to plot: By default this box is empty because all features are plotted. However, by selecting some specific features in this box, only these features are plotted   
  - Show points: By turning on this button, points corresponding to each sample are shown in each feature boxplots. If your data contain many features, this option can slow down the interactive visualization   
  - Split boxes: By default, boxplots of each feature are divided into the study groups. However, these boxplots can be overlapped by switching off this option
