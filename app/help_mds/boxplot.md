This tab provides a highly interactive boxplot that shows all data features by their different study groups. Each feature is represented by as many boxplots as there are groups in the study. Different visualization parameters are available in this tab:

  - Features to plot: By default this box is empty because all features are plotted. However, by selecting some specific features in this box, only these features are plotted   
  - Show points: By turning on this button, points corresponding to each sample are shown in each feature boxplots. If your data contain many features, this option can slow down the interactive display   
  - Split boxes: By default study group boxplots are overlapped in each feature. By turning on this button, study group boxplots are splitted in each feature. Only recommended if features selected to show are not too many (maximum 10 features)
