It's known that some factors can introduce variability in MS data. Even if the data have been generated under identical experimental conditions, this introduced variability can have a critical influence on the final statistical results, making normalization a key step in the workflow.

POMAShiny offers six different methods to normalize data:

  - Autoscaling 
  - Level scaling
  - Log scaling
  - Log transformation
  - Vast scaling
  - Log pareto scaling (default)
